## Overview
Mystery Hangman is a simple word-guessing game built using Python and Tkinter. The goal is to guess the hidden word by selecting letters one at a time before running out of attempts.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter
- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Interactive letter buttons for guessing
- Display of guessed letters and remaining attempts
- Game status messages (win or lose)
- Ability to start a new game at any time

## How to Play
1. A mystery word is selected at the start of the game.
2. Click on the letter buttons to guess letters.
3. Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.
4. Incorrect guesses decrease the number of attempts.
5. The game ends when either:
   - The word is fully revealed (You Win 🎉)
   - You run out of attempts (Game Over 💀)
6. Click the "New Game" button to restart.
